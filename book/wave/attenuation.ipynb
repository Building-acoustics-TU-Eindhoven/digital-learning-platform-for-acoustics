    "# Sound Attenuation in Acoustics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound attenuation refers to the gradual reduction of sound intensity as it propagates through a medium. This attenuation is primarily caused by two factors:\n",
    "1. **Classical Attenuation** – Due to viscosity and thermal conductivity.\n",
    "2. **Molecular Attenuation** – Due to energy redistribution among molecular modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive visualization, we explore how sound waves diminish over distance, controlled by key parameters such as **frequency**, **attenuation constant**, and **speed of sound**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Representation of Sound Attenuation\n",
    "\n",
    "A plane harmonic wave experiencing attenuation in a homogeneous medium can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: attenuated_wave\n",
    "p(x,t) = A e^{-\\frac{m}{2} x} e^{j(\\omega t - kx)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $A$ is the initial amplitude,\n",
    "- $m$ is the attenuation constant (in $\\text{m}^{-1}$),\n",
    "- $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$ is the angular frequency,\n",
    "- $k = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ is the wave number,\n",
    "- $c$ is the speed of sound,\n",
    "- $x$ is the distance,\n",
    "- $t$ is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exponential term $e^{-\\frac{m}{2} x}$ accounts for the amplitude decay as the wave propagates. A higher $m$ results in stronger attenuation, meaning the wave diminishes faster over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Interactive Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python-based interactive simulation allows users to visualize how sound waves attenuate as they travel through a medium. The key adjustable parameters are:\n",
    "- **Frequency ($f$ in Hz):** Determines the oscillation rate of the wave.\n",
    "- **Attenuation Constant ($m$ in $\\text{m}^{-1}$):** Defines how rapidly the wave diminishes over distance.\n",
    "- **Speed of Sound ($c$ in m/s):** Affects the wave propagation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Waveform Definition:**\n",
    "   - The function generates a plane wave that undergoes attenuation.\n",
    "   - The pressure wave is computed as a combination of **exponential decay** and **harmonic oscillation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - **Real Component (Re(p))**: Represents the oscillatory behavior of the wave.\n",
    "   - **Magnitude (abs(p))**: Shows the absolute envelope of the decaying wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactivity:**\n",
    "   - Users can **adjust the frequency**, **attenuation constant** using sliders.\n",
    "   - The plot dynamically updates to illustrate the effect of these parameters on attenuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting the Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher Frequencies ($f$):** Increase the oscillation rate but do not directly affect attenuation.\n",
    "- **Larger Attenuation Constant ($m$):** Causes the wave to decay more rapidly.\n",
    "- **Changes in Speed of Sound ($c$):** Modify the wavelength of the wave but do not directly control amplitude decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation provides an intuitive way to explore the physics of sound attenuation in different conditions.\n"

    "## Molecular Attenuation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular attenuation occurs due to the redistribution of acoustic energy among different molecular motion modes (translational, rotational, and vibrational). Unlike classical attenuation, molecular relaxation introduces frequency-dependent losses in sound propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular attenuation is described using the relaxation time $\\tau$, which represents the time needed for energy redistribution among molecular modes. The attenuation coefficient $m$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: molecular_attenuation\n",
    "m(\\omega) = \\frac{\\beta \\omega \\tau}{1 + (\\omega \\tau)^2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is a proportionality constant,\n",
    "- $\\tau$ is the relaxation time of the propagation medium,\n",
    "- $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency of the sound wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation highlights how molecular attenuation varies with frequency. The attenuation is strongest around a critical frequency, determined by $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Visualization of Molecular Attenuation\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive Python code visualizes how molecular attenuation depends on relaxation time. The key adjustable parameters are:\n",
    "- **Relaxation time ($\\tau$ in s):** Controls how energy redistributes among molecular states.\n",
    "- **Speed of Sound ($c$ in m/s):** Affects the propagation of sound waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attenuation Calculation:**\n",
    "   - The function computes the attenutation in dB over a range of attenuation coefficient $m(\\omega)$.\n",
    "   - The decay in wave amplitude is computed at a fixed distance ($x = 100$ m).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - The plot displays attenuation per kilometer (dB/km) on a logarithmic frequency scale.\n",
    "   - Users can observe how attenuation varies with frequency and relaxation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactivity:**\n",
    "   - Users adjust **$\\tau$** and **$c$** to see the influence on attenuation.\n",
    "   - The plot dynamically updates based on the chosen parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower $\\tau$ values:** Faster energy redistribution, causing lower attenuation.\n",
    "- **Higher $\\tau$ values:** Stronger frequency-dependent attenuation.\n",
    "- **Effect of Speed of Sound ($c$):** Alters the wave number but does not directly affect attenuation strength.\n",
