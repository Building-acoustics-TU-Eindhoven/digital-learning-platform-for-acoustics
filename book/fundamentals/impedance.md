# Introduction to Impedance

Impedance is a key concept in acoustics, describing the opposition a system presents to oscillatory motion when subjected to a driving force. Understanding impedance is critical for analyzing sound propagation, absorption, and reflection in various mediums.

## What is Impedance?

Impedance, denoted by $Z$, is defined as the ratio of the force to the velocity in a system:

```{math}
Z = \frac{F}{v}
```

where:
- $F$ is the force applied to the system.
- $v$ is the resulting velocity.

For harmonic motion, impedance is often represented as a complex quantity:

```{math}
Z = Z_r + jZ_i
```

where:
- $Z_r$ is the real part, representing resistance.
- $Z_i$ is the imaginary part, representing reactance (mass and stiffness effects).

## Types of Impedance

1. **Mechanical Impedance**: Resistance to motion in mechanical systems.
2. **Acoustic Impedance**: Resistance to sound propagation in a medium.

### Acoustic Impedance
Acoustic impedance is defined as:

```{math}
Z_0 = \frac{p}{v}
```

where:
- $p$ is the sound pressure.
- $v$ is the particle velocity.

In air, the characteristic impedance depends on the medium's density $\rho$ and the speed of sound $c$:

```{math}
Z_r = \rho c
```
