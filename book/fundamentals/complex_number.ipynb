    "# Introduction to Complex Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding complex numbers is crucial in acoustics for describing and analyzing oscillatory processes. Complex numbers provide an efficient way to represent quantities that oscillate sinusoidally, such as sound waves, by combining magnitude and phase into a single representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Complex Numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex number is expressed in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "z = a + bj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $a$ is the real part.\n",
    "- $b$ is the imaginary part.\n",
    "- $j$ is the imaginary unit, satisfying $j^2 = -1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers are fundamental in representing sinusoidal vibrations, where the real and imaginary components often correspond to physical amplitudes and phase shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers can be represented geometrically as points or vectors in the complex plane, with:\n",
    "- The x-axis representing the real part.\n",
    "- The y-axis representing the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polar Form\n",
    "In polar coordinates, a complex number is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "z = r e^{j\\theta}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $r = |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ is the magnitude.\n",
    "- $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(b/a)$ is the phase angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential form is particularly useful for analyzing oscillatory signals in acoustics, as it directly ties amplitude and phase into a compact representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition and Subtraction\n",
    "For two complex numbers $z_1 = a_1 + b_1j$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "z_1 + z_2 = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)j\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subtraction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)j\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication and Division\n",
    "- **Multiplication**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 e^{j(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Division**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} e^{j(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are straightforward in polar form and emphasize the role of magnitude and phase in acoustic signal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Conjugate\n",
    "The complex conjugate of $z = a + bj$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "z^* = a - bj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The conjugate is crucial in calculating power, impedance, and energy relationships in oscillatory systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz: Understanding Complex Numbers\n",

    "Convert the complex number $3 + 4j$ into its polar form. Determine its magnitude and phase angle.\n",
    ":::{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude is calculated as:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "|z| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase angle is:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\approx 53.13^\\circ\n",
