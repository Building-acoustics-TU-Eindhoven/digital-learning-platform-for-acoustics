    "# Harmonic Motion in Acoustics\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmonic motion is a foundational concept in acoustics, describing repetitive oscillatory movements. This behavior underpins many physical phenomena, including sound waves and vibrations, making it essential for understanding architectural acoustics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanics of harmonic motion involve its mathematical description and practical applications in acoustics, particularly in analyzing repetitive oscillations and their impact on physical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundation of Harmonic Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of harmonic oscillators can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "s(t) = s_\\text{amp} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $s_\\text{amp}$ represents the amplitude, indicating the maximum displacement from equilibrium.\n",
    "- $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency.\n",
    "- $f$ is the frequency of oscillation, measured in Hz.\n",
    "- $\\phi$ denotes the phase, determining the wave's offset in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between frequency and period is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f = \\frac{1}{T}, \\quad \\omega = 2\\pi f\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $T$ is the period, the time for one complete oscillation. These equations describe simple harmonic motion, which is crucial for understanding wave phenomena in acoustics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Demonstration\n",
    "Below is a Python code tha provides an opportunity to experiment with amplitude, phase, and frequency, visualizing their effects on harmonic motion. \n",
