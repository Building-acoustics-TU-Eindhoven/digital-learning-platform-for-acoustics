# Introduction to Fourier Analysis and Signal Processing

## 1. Historical Context and Motivation

Fourier Analysis, named after Joseph Fourier, was introduced in the early 19th century to study heat conduction. Fourier's idea that any periodic signal could be expressed as a sum of sine and cosine waves revolutionized mathematics and physics. Over time, Fourier analysis became the foundation for analyzing signals in various domains, including acoustics, communication, and image processing.

In acoustics, Fourier analysis provides a way to decompose complex sound waves into their frequency components. This decomposition enables the study of sound characteristics like pitch, tone, and timbre. By understanding the spectral content of sound signals, acousticians can design audio systems, analyze room acoustics, and create sound effects.

## 2. Role of Fourier Analysis in Acoustics

Fourier analysis is indispensable in acoustics due to its ability to:

- **Decompose Sound Waves**: Separate a sound wave into its frequency components, revealing harmonics and fundamental frequencies.
- **Analyze Room Acoustics**: Understand how different frequencies interact with architectural spaces, influencing reverberation and absorption.
- **Enable Filter Design**: Create filters to emphasize or suppress specific frequency bands.
- **Facilitate Signal Reconstruction**: Rebuild sound signals from discrete samples.

## 3. Overview of Frequency Domain Representation

A signal can be represented in:

- **Time Domain**: Shows how the signal varies over time.
- **Frequency Domain**: Displays the signal's spectral content, revealing the contribution of various frequencies.

The Fourier Transform bridges these representations. For a continuous signal $f(t)$, the Fourier Transform $F(\omega)$ is defined as:

```{math}
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-j \omega t} dt
```

The inverse transform reconstructs the time-domain signal:

```{math}
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{j \omega t} d\omega
```

More information on the Fourier Transform and its applications in acoustics is provided in subsequent [sections](./fourier_transform.ipynb).

**Benefits of Frequency Domain Representation**:

- Simplifies the analysis of linear systems.
- Highlights periodic components and harmonics.
- Enables efficient convolution through multiplication.

## 4. Classification of Signals

Signals are broadly classified into:

### A. **Continuous-Time vs. Discrete-Time Signals**

- **Continuous-Time**: Defined at every time instant (e.g., analog audio signals).
- **Discrete-Time**: Defined only at specific intervals (e.g., digital audio signals).

### B. **Periodic vs. Aperiodic Signals**

- **Periodic**: Repeats at regular intervals (e.g., musical tones).
- **Aperiodic**: Does not repeat (e.g., noise).

### C. **Deterministic vs. Random Signals**

- **Deterministic**: Completely defined by a mathematical function (e.g., sine waves).
- **Random**: Contains uncertainty and cannot be predicted precisely (e.g., background noise).

### D. **Energy vs. Power Signals**

- **Energy Signal**: Finite total energy, infinite duration.
- **Power Signal**: Infinite energy but finite average power over time.

## 5. Signal Sampling and Reconstruction

Signal sampling converts a continuous signal into a discrete one for digital processing. This process must adhere to the **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem**:

```{math}
F_s \geq 2F_{\max}
```

where:

- $F_s$: Sampling frequency.
- $F_{\max}$: Maximum frequency in the signal.

### Aliasing

If the sampling frequency is too low, aliasing occurs, causing high-frequency components to fold back into lower frequencies. This distortion can be avoided by applying an anti-aliasing filter before sampling.

### Reconstruction

Reconstruction involves converting the discrete samples back into a continuous signal using interpolation, often achieved through low-pass filtering.

**Applications in Acoustics**:

- Digitizing analog sound for storage and processing.
- Ensuring fidelity in audio playback systems.
