    "# Spherical Waves and Sound Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Spherical waves describe the propagation of sound from a point source in an isotropic medium. Unlike plane waves, spherical waves expand outward in all directions, leading to a reduction in intensity due to geometric spreading. Understanding spherical waves is crucial in modeling sound radiation from sources like musical instruments, loudspeakers, and environmental noise sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Representation of Spherical Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "A spherical wave emanating from a point source can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: spherical_wave\n",
    "p(r,t) = \\frac{A}{r} e^{j(\\omega t - kr)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $A$ is a scaling factor representing the source strength,\n",
    "- $r$ is the radial distance from the source,\n",
    "- $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency,\n",
    "- $k = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ is the wave number,\n",
    "- $c$ is the speed of sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $1/r$ term accounts for the **geometric spreading**, causing the amplitude to decrease with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sound Radiation from a Breathing Sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "A breathing sphere is an idealized acoustic source that expands and contracts uniformly, generating spherical waves. The total power radiated by a breathing sphere is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: radiated_power\n",
    "P = \\frac{S \\rho c k^2}{1 + k^2} \\frac{1}{2} v_A^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $S = 4\\pi a^2$ is the surface area of the sphere,\n",
    "- $\\rho$ is the air density,\n",
    "- $c$ is the speed of sound,\n",
    "- $k = \\frac{2\\pi f}{c} a$ is the non-dimensional wave number, a is the sphere radius,\n",
    "- $v_a$ is the velocity amplitude of the sphere surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation highlights how radiation efficiency varies with frequency and sphere size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Visualization of Sound Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive Python simulation allows users to explore how the power radiated by a breathing sphere varies with:\n",
    "- **Radius of the sphere ($a$ in m)**\n",
    "- **Speed of sound ($c$ in m/s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Radiation Power Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Computes the power radiated by a breathing sphere across a range of frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - The plot displays radiated power as a function of frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n",
    "   - Users can observe resonance effects and efficiency variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactivity:**\n",
    "   - Users adjust **$a$** and **$c$** to explore changes in power radiation.\n",
    "   - The graph dynamically updates based on input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small $a$ Values:** Lower overall power radiation due to reduced surface area.\n",
    "- **Higher $a$ Values:** Greater radiation efficiency at lower frequencies.\n",
    "- **Changes in Speed of Sound ($c$):** Affects the wave number and radiation characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation provides insights into spherical sound radiation and its dependence on frequency and source geometry.\n"
