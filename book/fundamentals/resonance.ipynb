    "# Introduction to Resonance\n",
    "\n",
    "Resonance is a fundamental phenomenon in acoustics, occurring when a system is driven at a frequency that matches one of its natural frequencies. This results in large amplitude oscillations due to the efficient transfer of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Resonance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Resonance occurs when the driving frequency aligns with the system's natural frequency, leading to a condition where the input energy is amplified. The natural frequency $f_0$ is determined by the system's physical properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $k$ is the stiffness of the system.\n",
    "- $m$ is the mass of the oscillating object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical acoustics, resonance explains phenomena such as the amplification of sound in musical instruments and the structural vibrations in buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Resonance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Amplitude Increase**: The amplitude of oscillation grows significantly near the resonance frequency.\n",
    "2. **Phase Shift**: At resonance, the system's phase shifts by $90^\\circ$ relative to the driving force.\n",
    "3. **Damping Effects**: In real systems, damping limits the amplitude and determines the sharpness of resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Damping and Quality Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The sharpness of resonance is characterized by the quality factor $Q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "Q = \\frac{f_0}{\\Delta f}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta f$ is the bandwidth of the resonance curve, defined as the frequency range where the amplitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz: Understanding Resonance\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{card} Exercise\n",
    "For a mass-spring-damping system with $m = 2 \\ \\text{kg}$, $k = 200 \\ \\text{N/m}$, and $c = 0.5 \\ \\text{Ns/m}$, calculate the natural frequency and quality factor. What happens if the damping is doubled?\n",
    ":::{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the natural frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{200}{2}} = 10 \\ \\text{rad/s}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the quality factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 m}{c} = \\frac{10 \\times 2}{0.5} = 40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the damping is doubled, $c = 1$, the new quality factor is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 m}{c} = 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Doubling the damping reduces the sharpness of the resonance and lowers the amplitude at the resonant frequency.\n",
